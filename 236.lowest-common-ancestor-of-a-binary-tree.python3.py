# Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes
# in the tree.
#
# According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor
# is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p
# and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
#
# Given the following binary tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
#

# ⁠       _______3______
# ⁠      /              \
# ⁠   ___5__          ___1__
# ⁠  /      \        /      \
# ⁠  6      _2       0       8
# ⁠        /  \
# ⁠        7   4
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The LCA of of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant
# of itself
# ⁠            according to the LCA definition.
#
# Note:
#
#
# All of the nodes' values will be unique.
# p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.
