# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3]'
#
# Given a set of distinct integers, nums, return all possible subsets (the
# power set).
#
# Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.
#
# Example:
#
#
# Input: nums = [1,2,3]
# Output:
# [
# ‚Å† [3],
# [1],
# [2],
# [1,2,3],
# [1,3],
# [2,3],
# [1,2],
# []
# ]
