# Testcase Example:  '"abcabcbb"'
#
# Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating
# characters.
# 
# Examples:
# 
# Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
# 
# Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.
# 
# Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the
# answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
#
class Solution:
    # @return an integer
